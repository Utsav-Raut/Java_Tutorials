The Map interfaces:

The following interfaces support maps-
Map = Maps unique keys to values
Map.Entry = Describes an element (a key/value pair) in a map. This is an inner class of Map.
SortedMap = Extends Map so that the keys are maintained in ascending order.
Navigable Map = Extends SortedMap to handle the retrieval entries based on closest-match searches.

========================================================================================================

The Map Classes:

AbstractMap = Implements most of Map(interface) methods
EnumMap = Extends AbstractMap for use with enum keys
HashMap = Extends AbstractMap to use a hash table
TreeMap = Extends AbstractMap to use a tree.
WeakHashMap = Extends AbstractMap to use a hash table with weak keys
LinkedHashMap = Extends HashMap to allow insertion-order iterations
IdentityHashMap = Extends AbstractMap and uses reference equality when comparing documents.

Notes:
(a) AbstractMap is a superclass for all concrete map implementations
(b) WeakHashMap implements a map that uses "weak keys", which allows an element in a map to be garbage-collected when it's key is otherwise unused.
