Method Reference is an imp feature related to lambda expressions.
A method reference provides a way to refer to a method without executing it.
It relates to lambda expressions because it, too, requires a target type context that consists of a compatible functional interface.
When evaluated, a method reference also creates an instance of the functional interface.
