Maps:
A map is an object that stores associations between keys and values, or key/value pairs.
Given a key, we can find its value. Both keys and values are objects.
The key must be unique but the values may be duplicated. 
Some maps can accept null keys and null values, others cannot.

Maps do not implement the Iterable interface. This means that we cannot cycle through a map using a for-each style for loop.
Also, we cannot obtain an iterator to a map. However we can obtain a collection-view of a map, which allows the use of iterator or the for loop
